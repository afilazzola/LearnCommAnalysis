Description:Ecologists are generally expected to know a larger range of statistics relative to other fields in biology. However, knowledge of the appropriate statistic test to answer an ecological question can be a major limitation for researchers. This package provides the most used functions and packages that are used in community ecology for analyzing data. This package is to complement the workshop that provides specific examples of different analyses in community ecology. https://afilazzola.github.io/UoA.CommunityAnalyses.2018/
